      <h2 class="recipe__subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <h4>Sauce:</h4>
        <li>2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>

        <li>1/2 cup evaporated milk</li>

        <li>1/3 cup half and half</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <h4 class="recipe__subtitle">Pancakes:</h4>
        <li>
          1 (15.25 oz) box French vanilla cake mix (such as Betty Crockerâ„¢ Super
          Moist French Vanilla Cake Mix)
        </li>

        <li>1 1/4 cups almond milk</li>

        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>

        <li>1/2 cup whipped cream, or as needed (optional)</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="recipe__subtitle">Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half and half
          in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring to a boil,
          stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
          This is a sauce, not a syrup, so consistency will be on the thinner
          side.
        </li>

        <li>
          Add cake mix, almond milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil to a
          large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly coat
          with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter for each
          pancake. Cook until edges begin to puff up, small bubbles appear, pop,
          and leave small holes, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until
          golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes more.
        </li>

        <li>
          Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of the tres leches sauce, a dollop
          of whipped cream, and sprinkle of cinnamon.
        </li>
      </ol>
